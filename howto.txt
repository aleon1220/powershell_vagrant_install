Powershell script to quickly install Vagrant, Oracle Virtualbox and Cygwin on Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or Windows 10

I have been asked a couple of times if there is a faster way to install Vagrant, Oracle Virtualbox and Cygwin in order to run Linux virtual 
machines on Windows.

I finally got around to writing a simple Powershell script that does the job.



System requirements:

Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 or Windows 10
Internet-enabled PC to automatically download packages

I tested this on a vanilla Windows 7 SP1 desktop and had to upgrade Powershell 2.0 in order to run Vagrant by downloading 
and installing Windows6.1-KB2819745-x64-MultiPkg.msu from the web page 
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/21016.how-to-install-windows-powershell-4-0.aspx

After that I had to reboot Windows.



How to use the script:

Open a Powershell prompt in Windows AS AN ADMINISTRATOR.

Type the full path to the script to run it, for example:
C:\temp\vagrant.ps1

(see screen capture images, 1.png, 2.png and 3.png)

To use Vagrant afterwards, simply create a folder "ubuntu" under C:\Vagrantboxes, add a file named "Vagrantfile" (no extension) under there.

A classic example of what to put in the Vagrantfile can be found at https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64


Running Vagrant:

My experience was no Windows reboot was necessary after install.

Open Cygwin Terminal (or Cygwin64 Terminal)

Type the commands:

cd /cygdrive/c/Vagrantboxes/ubuntu
vagrant up

Be patient.

To log in to the image once it's ready (NO PASSWORD REQUIRED):

vagrant ssh

To bring down the image:

vagrant halt
